# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing transaction data, the model can classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping financial institutions reduce losses from fraud.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

# Change into the project directory
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can run the fraud detection model using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure to replace `main.py` with the actual script that runs your model.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud). This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 

- **Features**:
  - `Time`: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
  - `V1`, `V2`, ..., `V28`: Anonymized features (due to confidentiality).
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `Class`: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate).

## Modeling

This project implements various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

The models are trained and evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of true results among the total number of cases examined.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive results in the positive class.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive results in all actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The best-performing model will be highlighted in the results section after evaluation.
